## Population genomic analyses of honeybee populations 
 
 
Analysis of the 90 new samples by aligning Illumina reads to one of the reference genomes (BWA) and then
genomes (BWA), then detection of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphosm) using the GATK pipeline developed in the
GATK pipeline developed in the laboratory. The data thus generated are then compared using a PCA
and Admixture analysis, with those of the 43 samples from 2014, in order to confirm the homogeneity
of the Corsican bee population and its stability over time.
The proportion of Italian bee genome in the overall genetic profile and its distribution along the chromosomes (RFMix) will be
in relation to the staining phenotype. The analyses were performed on the
Genotoul Bioinfo computing cluster.
